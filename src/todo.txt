1. When user logs in, check if id exists. If yes, continue login. Mark account as isActive=true in supabase.
If no, create a new account and continue login.

2. Create a new room. Navigate to /room/host/[roomId]
Assign this new room to supabase db with isActive=True.
Save this state in context in NextJs.
[host's current room + alreadyJoined=true + display name]

3. On joining the room, show a list of other logged in users. Fetch the other users active room id.
Save this state in context - list of users - each user to have a field already connected to
When a particular user is selected, navigate to that roomId - /room/remote/[roomId]

4. When leave that room, fetch host's current room from state and navigate to /room/host/[roomId].
Do not show the form to fill in display name if alreadyJoined=true.
Fetch display name from context.
Join the room directly.
Show list of users online minus the user connected previously by using already connected to list.

5. SignOut
Event - users.isActive for current user = false | reset rooms table's rows as well
